\title{Create unit hydrograph matrix of the Lohmann routing model.}
\usage{
Lohmann_uh(river, stn_loc, v = 1.5, diff = 800)
}
\arguments{
\item{river}{River network table like the output of function
\code{dir2river()}.}

\item{stn_loc}{Hydrological station located in which river channel.}

\item{v}{Flow velocity of the river channel \link{m}.}

\item{diff}{Water diffusion coefficient of the river channel.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the UH of each gridcells.
}
\description{
Create unit hydrograph matrix of the Lohmann
routing model. Each column is the UH of each
subbasins while each row is the UH of each time
steps.
